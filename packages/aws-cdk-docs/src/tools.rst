Command-line Toolkit (cdk)
--------------------------

``cdk`` (the |toolkit|) is the main tool you use to interact with your |*CDK App*|. It will execute
the CDK app you have written and compiled, interrogate the application
model you have defined, and produce and deploy the CloudFormation templates
generated by it.

You have to tell ``cdk`` what command to use to run your CDK app using the
``--app`` option. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   cdk --app 'node bin/main.js' synth

Because this is rather tedious to repeat every time, you will generally put
this option in a file called *cdk.json*:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "app": "node bin/main.js"
   }

Below are the actions you can take on your CDK app:

.. code-block:: sh

   Usage: cdk -a <cloud-executable> COMMAND

   Commands:
     docs                        Opens the documentation in a browser
     list                        Lists all stacks in the cloud executable (alias:
                                 ls)
     synth [STACKS..]            Synthesizes and prints the cloud formation
                                 template for this stack (alias: synthesize,
                                 construct, cons)
     bootstrap [ENVIRONMENTS..]  Deploys the CDK toolkit stack into an AWS
                                 environment
     deploy [STACKS...]          Deploys the stack(s) named STACKS into your AWS
                                 account
     destroy [STACKS...]         Destroy the stack(s) named STACKS
     diff [STACK]                Compares the specified stack with the deployed
                                 stack or a local template file
     metadata [STACK]            Returns all metadata associated with this stack
     init [TEMPLATE]             Create a new, empty CDK project from a template.
                                 Invoked without TEMPLATE, the app template will be
                                 used.

   Options:
     --help         Show help                                             [boolean]
     --app, -a      REQUIRED: Command-line of cloud executable (e.g. "node
                   bin/my-app.js")                                        [string]
     --context, -c  Add contextual string parameter.                        [array]
     --plugin, -p   Name or path of a node package that extend the CDK features.
                   Can be specified multiple times                         [array]
     --rename       Rename stack name if different then the one defined in the
                   cloud executable                                       [string]
     --trace        Print trace for stack warnings                        [boolean]
     --strict       Do not construct stacks with warnings                 [boolean]
     --json, -j     Use JSON output instead of YAML                       [boolean]
     --verbose, -v  Show debug logs                                       [boolean]
     --version      Show version number                                   [boolean]

   If your app has a single stack, there is no need to specify the stack name

   If one of cdk.json or ~/.cdk.json exists, options specified there will be used
   as defaults. Settings in cdk.json take precedence.

.. _using_cdk_init:

Using cdk init to Create a Project
==================================

The :ref:`getting_started` topic manually creates a |cdk| project.
This section describes how to create an empty project using the **cdk init** command.

Create a directory for your project,
and navigate into that directory.

.. code-block:: sh

    mkdir hello-cdk
    cd hello-cdk

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: JavaScript

      Create a new |cdk| project in JavaScript.

      .. code-block:: sh

         cdk init -l javascript

   .. group-tab:: TypeScript

      Create a new |cdk| project in TypeScript.

      .. code-block:: sh

         cdk init -l typescript

   .. group-tab:: java

      Create a new |cdk| project in Java.

      .. code-block:: sh

         cdk init -l Java

You now have an |cdk| app.

- To compile your code, if required, see :ref:`compiling_code`
- To list the stacks in your app, use the **cdk ls** command
- To synthesize an |CFN| template, use the **cdk synth** command
- To deploy your stack (create your AWS resources), use the **cdk deploy** command

.. _version-reporting:

Version Reporting
=================

In order to gain insights in how the |cdk| is used, the versions of libraries used by |cdk| applications are collected
and reported using a resource identified as ``AWS::CDK::Metadata`` that is added to CloudFormation templates, and can easily
be reviewed. This information may also be used to identify stacks using a package with known serious security or
reliability issues and contact their users with important information.

The |cdk| reports the name and version of npm modules that are loaded into the application at synthesis time, unless
their ``package.json`` file contains the ``"private": true`` attribute.

The ``AWS::CDK::Metadata`` resource looks like the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

   CDKMetadata:
     Type: "AWS::CDK::Metadata"
     Properties:
       Modules: "@aws-cdk/core=0.7.2-beta,@aws-cdk/s3=0.7.2-beta,lodash=4.17.10"

.. _version-reporting-opt-out:

Opting-out from Version Reporting


To out-out, use one of the following methods:

* Use the ``--no-version-reporting`` in ``cdk`` invocations:

    .. code-block:: sh

        cdk --no-version-reporting synth

* Set ``versionReporting`` to ``false`` in **./cdk.json** or **~/cdk.json**:

    .. code-block:: js

        {
          "app": "...",
          "versionReporting": false
        }
