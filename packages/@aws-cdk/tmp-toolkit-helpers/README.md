A temporary private package to hold CLI and Toolkit library files.
The package is used by the Programmatic Toolkit package `@aws-cdk/toolkit` and the AWS CDK CLI `aws-cdk`.

**Do not rely on this package!**
It's contents will gradually be moved over to `@aws-cdk/toolkit` and eventually the package will seize to exist.
