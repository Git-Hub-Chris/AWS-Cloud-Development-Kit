Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics allow you to monitor your application by continuously generating **synthetic** traffic. This traffic is generated by a **canary** which will hit your endpoint as if it were a customer, allowing you to verify the health of your endpoint.

## Creating a Canary

Every time a canary runs, it executes a supplied script which defines the code that hits your endpoint. For example, if you have an API gateway endpoint: 

```ts
const backend = new lambda.Function(...);
new apigateway.LambdaRestApi(this, 'dateReturner', {
  handler: backend,
});
```

The api gateway exposes the following url: example.com/date.

A canary can be used to monitor this endpoint. 

```ts
const canary = new Canary(this, 'my_test', {
  canaryName: 'date-endpoint-canary',
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: Code.fromInline('// The code that hits 'example.com/date' goes here'),
});
```

The canary will automatically produce this CloudWatch Dashboard:

Canaries can be used to monitor architecture at any level of complexity, from a simple endpoint to a complete website. This level of complexity is determined by the script it runs, and you can customize it to fit your application's needs.

### Adding an Alarm to your Canary

You can configure a CloudWatch Alarm on canary metrics. Metrics are emitted by CloudWatch automatically and can be accessed by the following APIs:
- `canary.metricSuccessPercent(props?)`
- `canary.metricDuration(props?)`
- `canary.metricFailed(props?)`

```ts
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromInline('foo'),
});

canary.createAlarm('CanaryAlarm', {
  metric: canary.metricSuccessPercent(),
  evaluationPeriods: 2,
  threshold: 90,
  comparisonOperator: cloudwatch.ComparisonOperator.LESS_THAN_THRESHOLD,
})
```

### Canary Code

To create a canary that executes complicated scripts, you can use `Code.fromAsset(path)` or `Code.fromBucket(bucket,key)`:

```ts

// Code.fromInline()
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromInline('foo'),
});

// Code.fromAsset()
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromAsset('./scripts'),
});

// Code.fromBucket()
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromBucket(bucket, key),
});
```

- `Code.fromInline(code)` - inline the handle code as a string.
- `Code.fromAsset(path)` - specify a directory or a .zip file in the local filesystem which will be zipped and uploaded to S3 before deployment. See also [bundling asset code](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-lambda#Bundling-Asset-Code). Every time you change your canary script in the asset, an asset hash will be updated to ensure that the stack will be updated accordingly.
- `Code.fromBucket(bucket, key, objectVersion?)` - specify an S3 object that contains the archive of your runtime code.
