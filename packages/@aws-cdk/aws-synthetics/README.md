Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics allow you to monitor your application by continuously generating **synthetic** traffic. This traffic is generated by a **canary** which will hit your endpoint as if it were a customer, allowing you to verify the health of your endpoint.

## Creating a Canary

Every time a canary runs, it executes a supplied script which defines the code that hits your endpoint. For example, if you have an API gateway endpoint: 

```ts
const backend = new lambda.Function(...);
new apigateway.LambdaRestApi(this, 'dateReturner', {
  handler: backend,
});
```

The api gateway exposes the following url: example.com/date.

A canary can be used to monitor this endpoint. 

```ts
const canary = new Canary(this, 'my_test', {
  canaryName: 'date-endpoint-canary',
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: Code.fromInline('// The code that hits 'example.com/date' goes here'),
  rate: Rate.EVERY_MINUTE,
});
```

The canary will automatically produce this CloudWatch Dashboard:

Canaries can be used to monitor architecture at any level of complexity, from a simple endpoint to a complete website. This level of complexity is determined by the script it runs, and you can customize it to fit your application's needs.

### Adding an Alarm to your Canary

You can configure a CloudWatch Alarm on canary metrics. Metrics are emitted by CloudWatch automatically and can be accessed by the following APIs:
- `canary.metricSuccessPercent(props?)`
- `canary.metricDuration(props?)`
- `canary.metricFailed(props?)`

```ts
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromInline('foo'),
});

canary.createAlarm('CanaryAlarm', {
  metric: canary.metricSuccessPercent(),
  evaluationPeriods: 2,
  threshold: 90,
  comparisonOperator: cloudwatch.ComparisonOperator.LESS_THAN_THRESHOLD,
})
```

### Canary Code

In addition to `Code.fromInline()`, you can use `Code.fromAsset(path)` or `Code.fromBucket(bucket,key)` for more complicated use cases:

```ts
// Code.fromAsset()
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromAsset('./scripts'),
});

// Code.fromBucket()
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromBucket(bucket, key),
});
```

- `Code.fromAsset(path)` - specify a directory or a .zip file in the local filesystem which will be zipped and uploaded to S3 before deployment. See also [bundling asset code](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-lambda#Bundling-Asset-Code). When your application builds, the folder structure `nodejs/node_modules` will be automatically appended to your local directory.
- `Code.fromBucket(bucket, key, objectVersion?)` - specify an S3 object that contains the archive of your runtime code. 

### Discussion + Future Work

- Modeling the `Schedule` property

  - Currently the Canary L1 takes a mandatory `Schedule` property that is an object with `DurationInSeconds` and `Expression` as sub-properties. `DurationInSeconds` specifies how long the canary should be active for and `Expression` defines how often the canary runs. I propose the L2 specifies two optional properties, `lifetime` and `rate`. `lifetime` replaces `DurationInSeconds` and offers a logical name to what the property controls, while `rate` is an enum that specifies the `Expression` in a discoverable way. 

  - I expect the `rate` property to look something like this in the constructor: `rate: Rate.EVERY_MINUTE` or `rate: Rate.RUN_ONCE`.
  
  - I currently have the default of `lifetime = 0` (runs forever) and `rate: Rate.EVERY_FIVE_MINUTES`.
  
- Modeling the `RunConfig` property

  - The Canary L1 takes a mandatory `RunConfig` property which is an object with a `TimeoutInSeconds` sub-property. This provides the upper-bound in how long the canary can run. I propose the L2 specifies the optional property `timeout` which defaults to the duration in `rate`.
