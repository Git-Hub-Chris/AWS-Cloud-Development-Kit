Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics allow you to monitor your application by continuously generating **synthetic** traffic. This traffic is generated by a **canary** which will hit your endpoint as if it were a customer, allowing you to verify the health of your endpoint.

## Using a Canary

Say you have an endpoint that you need to monitor: 

```ts
const backend = new lambda.Function(...);
new apigateway.LambdaRestApi(this, 'myapi', {
  handler: backend,
});
```

The endpoint looks like this:

You can create a canary to monitor this endpoint: 

```ts
const canary = new Canary(this, 'my_test', {
  canaryName: 'date-endpoint-canary',
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: Code.fromInline('// The code that hits your endpoint goes here'),
});
```

Canaries can be used to monitor architecture at any level of complexity, from a simple endpoint in this example to a complete website. This level of complexity is determined by the script it runs, and you can customize it to fit your application's needs.

### Adding a Metric to your Canary

CloudWatch Synthetics also emit canary metrics for you. You can reference a published metric through the suite of metric APIs:

- `canary.metricSuccessPercent(props?)`
- `canary.metricDuration(props?)`
- `canary.metricFailed(props?)`

### Adding an Alarm to your Canary

You can add an alarm to your canary by using the `canary.createAlarm()` API: 

```ts
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromInline('foo'),
});

canary.createAlarm('CanaryAlarm', {
  metric: canary.metricSuccessPercent(),
  evaluationPeriods: 2,
  threshold: 90,
  comparisonOperator: cloudwatch.ComparisonOperator.LESS_THAN_THRESHOLD,
})
```

### More Complicated Uses

There are three ways to specify the script that the canary should run:

```ts

// Code.fromInline()
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromInline('foo'),
});

// Code.fromAsset()
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromAsset('./scripts'),
});

// Code.fromBucket()
const canary = new synth.Canary(this,'mycanary',{
  handler: 'index.handler',
  canaryName: 'mycanary',
  code: synth.Code.fromBucket(bucket, key),
});
```

- `Code.fromInline(code)` - inline the handle code as a string.
- `Code.fromAsset(path)` - specify a directory or a .zip file in the local filesystem which will be zipped and uploaded to S3 before deployment. See also [bundling asset code](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-lambda#Bundling-Asset-Code). Every time you change your canary script in the asset, an asset hash will be updated to ensure that the stack will be updated accordingly.
- `Code.fromBucket(bucket, key, objectVersion?)` - specify an S3 object that contains the archive of your runtime code.
