Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics allow you to monitor your application by generating **synthetic** traffic. The traffic is produced by a **canary**: a configurable script that runs on a schedule. You configure the canary script to follow the same routes and perform the same actions as a user, which allows you to continually verify your user experience even when you don't have any traffic on your applications.

Sections marked with ðŸš§ are not yet implemented and are mentioned here for the sake of completeness  

## Canary

To illustrate how to use a canary, assume your application defines the following endpoint:

```bash
% curl "https://api.example.com/user/books/topbook/"
The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy

```

The below code defines a canary that will hit the `books/topbook` endpoint every 5 minutes: 
> ðŸš§ Note the `Test` class is not yet implemented and is presented here to give reviewer context

```ts
import * as synthetics from '@aws-cdk/aws-synthetics';

const canary = new synthetics.Canary(this, 'MyCanary', {
  schedule: synthetics.Schedule.rate(Duration.minutes(5)),
  test: synthetics.Test.custom({ // ðŸš§ Not yet implemented 
    code: synthetics.Code.fromInline(`const https = require('https');
      var synthetics = require('Synthetics');
      const log = require('SyntheticsLogger');
  
      exports.handler = async function () {
        const requestOptions = {"hostname":"api.example.com","method":"","path":"/user/books/topbook/","port":443}
        let req = https.request(requestOptions);
        req.on('response', (res) => {
          log.info()
        });
      }`),
    handler: 'index.handler',
  }),
});
```

The canary will automatically produce a CloudWatch Dashboard:

### Canary Test ðŸš§

The `test` property represents the test the canary executes. You can supply you own code using the `Test.custom()` method, or you can use a blueprint e.g `Test.heartbeat()`.

#### Custom ðŸš§

which will allow you to specify a custom script and handler for the canary. To specify the script in the `code` property, use the static method `code.fromInline()`.

```ts
const canary = new Canary(this, 'MyCanary', {
  test: Test.custom({ // ðŸš§ Not yet implemented 
    code: Code.fromInline('exports.handler = async () => {\nconsole.log(\'hello world\');\n};'),
    handler: 'index.handler',
  }),
});
```

#### Blueprints ðŸš§

TODO add description

### Alarms

You can configure a CloudWatch Alarm on canary metrics. Metrics are emitted by CloudWatch automatically and can be accessed by the following APIs:
- `canary.metricSuccessPercent()` - percentage of successful canary runs over a given time
- `canary.metricDuration()` - how much time each canary run takes
- `canary.metricFailed()` - number of failed canary runs over a given time

Create an alarm that tracks the canary metric:

```ts
new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'CanaryAlarm', {
  metric: canary.metricSuccessPercent(),
  evaluationPeriods: 2,
  threshold: 90,
  comparisonOperator: cloudwatch.ComparisonOperator.LESS_THAN_THRESHOLD,
});
```
