 * After the initial creation of a stack set, you can add new stack instances by
 * using CloudFormationStackInstances. Template parameter values can be
 * overridden at the stack instance level during create or update stack set
 * instance operations.
 *
 * Each stack set has one template and set of template parameters. When you
 * update the template or template parameters, you update them for the entire
 * set. Then all instance statuses are set to OUTDATED until the changes are
 * deployed to that instance.
