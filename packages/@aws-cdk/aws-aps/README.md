## Introduction

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a Prometheus-compatible monitoring and alerting service that makes it easy to monitor containerized applications and infrastructure at scale. The Cloud Native Computing Foundationâ€™s Prometheus project is a popular open source monitoring and alerting solution optimized for container environments. With Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, you can use the open source Prometheus query language (PromQL) to monitor and alert on the performance of containerized workloads, without having to scale and operate the underlying infrastructure. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus automatically scales the ingestion, storage, alerting, and querying of operational metrics as workloads grow or shrink, and is integrated with AWS security services to enable fast and secure access to data. The service is integrated with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.

## Workspace

The `Workspace` construct allows you to create Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace: 
> This is the bare minimum to get going

```ts
const workspace = new Workspace(stack, 'workspace');
```

## RuleGroupsNamespace

The `RuleGroupsNamespace` construct allows you to add namespace into Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus(AMP) workspace:

```ts
const workspace = new Workspace(stack, 'workspace');

const ruleGroupsNamespace = new RuleGroupsNamespace(stack, 'DemoWorkspace', {
    name: 'DemoRuleGroupsNamespace',
    workspace,
    data: `groups:
  - name: test
    rules:
    - record: metric:recording_rule
      expr: avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m]))
  - name: alert-test
    rules:
    - alert: metric:alerting_rule
      expr: avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) > 0
      for: 2m`});

```
