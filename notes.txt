Some notes about testing

To verify the current code, I have created a standalone cdk application that has
dependencies directly on locally created tarballs for aws-cdk-lib and
@aws-cdk/lambda-layer-awscli which are generated from running `yarn package` in
the corresponding directory.

npm install doesn't like it when I change the contents of the tarball, and
reinstall with the same file name. So I've manually incremented the version
number at the end. This is not a good workflow. We need a better one for
developing this project.
