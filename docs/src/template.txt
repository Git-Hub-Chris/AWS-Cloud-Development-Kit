        Creating a Project from the Template
        ====================================
        
        As mentioned previously,
        you can use the :code:`cdk init` command to create a skeleton project from a
        template in any of the supported languages.
        In this section we'll do just that.
        
        .. _initialize:
        
        Initializing the Project
        ------------------------
        
        Run the `cdk init` command to initialize an empty project.
        The |cdk| contains templates for all of the supported languages.
        To create an empty (no AWS resources in the resulting |CFN| stack),
        run the following command, where LANGUAGE is one of the supported programming languages:
        **csharp** (C#), **java** (Java), or **typescript** (TypeScript).
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            cdk init --language LANGUAGE
        
        .. _compile_project:
        
        Compiling the Project
        ---------------------
        
        If needed, compile the code:
        
        .. tabs::
        
            .. group-tab:: C#
        
                Compile the code using your IDE or via the dotnet CLI:
        
                .. code-block:: sh
        
                    dotnet build
        
            .. group-tab:: JavaScript
        
                No need to compile
        
            .. group-tab:: TypeScript
        
                To compile your program from **.ts** to **.js**:
        
                .. code-block:: sh
        
                    npm run build
        
                You can also use the **watch** command to continuously compile your code
                as it changes, so you don't have to invoke the compiler explicitly:
        
                .. code-block:: sh
        
                    # run in another terminal session
                    npm run watch
        
            .. group-tab:: Java
        
                Compile your code using your IDE or via the command line via **mvn**:
        
                .. code-block:: sh
        
                    mvn compile
        
        You have now created your first |cdk| app.
